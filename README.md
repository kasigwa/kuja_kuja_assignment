# Data Analysis and Results Discussion

I have created a Tableau dashboard to analyse the data provided with the help of the schema mentioned about the data.

1. Here are some of the insights that are analysed and visualised from the dashboard.
2. Overall, 55.57% of the customers have given their satisfaction and 44.43% of the people have said that they are not satisfied.
3. 89.32% of males and 10.68% of females submitted their responses.
4. Among women, approx 30% are not satisfied and among men, 46.22% of them are unsatisfied.
5. In Rwanda and Somalia, Men are slightly more satisfied than women whereas, in Uganda, women have more percentage of satisfaction.
6. Generally, Females are more satisfied with a higher percentage than men.
7. Uganda is the nation where most people are unsatisfied (24.71%) whereas Rwanda is where most people are satisfied (27.30%).
8. Rwanda has the maximum %age of females (18.12%), whereas Somalia has the least %age of women (1.43%). On the other hand, Somalia has 98.57% of maximum males and Rwanda has the least %age of men.
9. There are certain keywords that are related to unsatisfied customers. The top 10 are water, food, vane, latrines, door, hygiene, wash, houses, education and nutrition.
10. An average of 640 ideas have been submitted from all the locations.
11. Mahama Camp location has the maximum number of ideas whereas Bidi Bidi Zone 5 has the least number of ideas submitted by the population.
12. Location Gihembe Camp with a satisfaction level of 93.35% outperforms all the other locations. On the other hand, Nakivale Base Camp performed the worst with regard to satisfaction level.
13. Service Type 'HealthCare' has the maximum %age of satisfaction (61%) whereas 'Shelter' has the maximum dissatisfaction of 61%.

Few suggestions and work that we can do with this data:

* Also, we can use word clouds that could help to visualise the words used by people the majority of the time in the Idea column.
* We can plot n-grams (bigrams/trigrams) to find the words used together in the idea column.
* We can use Topic Modelling (Unsupervised Learning) to find certain topics people are talking about in the Idea column.
